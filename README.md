***HOW IT'S MADE***
-
Tech used: Python, HTML, Django

I followed multiple tutorials and courses to create this simple yet working prototype website. At the moment, it has limited functionality, but I plan to improve it over time.

***WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT***
-
* How to use the Django framework to create websites using Python

* Different methods and ways to solve problems in Python

***PLANS FOR THE FUTURE***
-
* **Search Functionality** - Implement search functionality with a movie filter I made instead of entering movie names manually. (Movie filter demo is in the files)

* **Movie Posters** - Displaying movie posters with the titles.

* **Details Page** - Create a page for movies that displays genres, release dates, directors, actors, run times, languages, and an overview.

* **Commenting** - Allow users to comment on the movies in their list.

* **Analytics Dashboard** - Provide insights like the total number of movies watched, favorite genres, or time spent watching.
